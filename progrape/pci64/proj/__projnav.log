INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (0). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '1'. Additional information on "stepping

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:738 - Unexpected DCM configuration. DCM comp
   dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM has CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT set without a connection from CLKO or
   CLK2X to CLKFB. To achieve fine-grained phase shifting (CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT =
   FIXED or VARIABLE), CLKFB must be connected to either CLK0 or CLK2X.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal
   CK66_IBUFG on the CLKFB pin of comp dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM is not driven by an IOB
   or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot
   be guaranteed.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

INFO:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some
   suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.
   

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place
   & Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
   the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Run Multi-Pass Place and Route in PAR using at least 5 "PAR Iterations"
   (ISE process "Multi Pass Place & Route").

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go
   to either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or
   " TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (0). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '1'. Additional information on "stepping

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:738 - Unexpected DCM configuration. DCM comp
   dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM has CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT set without a connection from CLKO or

   FIXED or VARIABLE), CLKFB must be connected to either CLK0 or CLK2X.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal
   CK66_IBUFG on the CLKFB pin of comp dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM is not driven by an IOB
   or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot
   be guaranteed.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:738 - Unexpected DCM configuration. DCM comp

   FIXED or VARIABLE), CLKFB must be connected to either CLK0 or CLK2X.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal
   CK66_IBUFG on the CLKFB pin of comp dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM is not driven by an IOB
   or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot
   be guaranteed.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <PRERD_CNT<3>> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.

   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <PCI_CORE/PCI_LC/ACK64-> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:738 - Unexpected DCM configuration. DCM comp
   dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM has CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT set without a connection from CLKO or
   CLK2X to CLKFB. To achieve fine-grained phase shifting (CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT =
   FIXED or VARIABLE), CLKFB must be connected to either CLK0 or CLK2X.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal
   CK66_IBUFG on the CLKFB pin of comp dcm_ps_f0/U_DCM is not driven by an IOB
   or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot
   be guaranteed.
