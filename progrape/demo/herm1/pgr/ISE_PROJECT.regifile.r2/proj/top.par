INFO:Par:338 - 
   Extra Effort Level "c"ontinue is not a runtime optimized effort level. It is
   intended to be used for designs that are not meeting timing but where the
   designer wants the tools to continue iterating on the design until no further
   design speed improvements are possible.  This can result in very long
   runtimes since the tools will continue improving the design even if the time
   specs can not be met. If you are looking for the best possible design speed
   available from a long but reasonable runtime use Extra Effort Level "n"ormal.
    It will stop iterating on the design when the design speed improvements have
   shrunk to the point that the time specs are not expected to be met.

Constraints file: top.pcf.
Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '3s5000.nph' in environment /tmp/Xilinx.
   "top" is an NCD, version 3.1, device xc3s5000, package fg900, speed -5

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)


Device speed data version:  "ADVANCED 1.37 2005-11-04".


INFO:Par:253 - The Map -timing placement will be retained since it is likely to achieve better performance.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.
