WARNING:XdmHelpers:793 - The TNM "CLK66" drives the CLKIN pin of DCM
   "dcm0/dcm0". This TNM cannot be traced through the DCM because it is not used
   exclusively by one PERIOD specification. This TNM is used in the following
   user groups and/or specifications:
   <none>
WARNING:XdmHelpers:625 - No instances driven from the following signals or pins
   are valid for inclusion in TNM group "CLK66". A TNM property on a pin or
   signal marks only the flip-flops, latches and/or RAMs which are directly or
   indirectly driven by that pin or signal.
   signal "CK66"
INFO:XdmHelpers:851 - TNM "CK66", used in period specification "TS_CK66", was
   traced into DCM instance "dcm0/dcm0". The following new TNM groups and period
   specifications were generated at the DCM output(s):
   CLK0: TS_dcm0_dcm_out=PERIOD dcm0_dcm_out TS_CK66*1.000000 HIGH 50.000000%
   CLKFX: TS_dcm0_dcm_fx=PERIOD dcm0_dcm_fx TS_CK66*1.000000 HIGH 50.000000%
WARNING:XdmHelpers:644 - No appropriate elements were found for the TNM group
   "CLK66". This group has been removed from the design.
