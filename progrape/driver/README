These are the release notes for the PROGRAPE device driver.  Read them
carefully, as they tell you what is all about, explain how to install
the device driver, and what to do if something goes wrong.

INSTALLING the device driver:

 - COMPILING the device driver:

   make clean
   make

 - LOADING the device driver:

   make load

 - UNLOADING the device driver:

   make unload


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:
 - If you have problems that seem to be due to the device driver bugs,
   please check the system log files such as /var/log/kern.log etc.
   To enable debugging output to system logfile(such as /proc/kmsg),
   uncomment a line of 'DEBUG=y' in Makefile.
